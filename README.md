# From Information to Meaning: Foundations of Knowledge Representation & Discovery


![IIWU Learning Path](IIWU_Learning_Path.png)


_Audience: You (and future IIWU collaborators)
Technically literate, conceptually curious, not necessarily academic_

A learning track through important concepts that help you understand what it means to build a **Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic System**.

## Learning Modules

* [Module 0 — Orientation: Why This Track Exists](modules/0_Orientation.md)
* [Module 1 — What Is Knowledge, Really?](modules/1_Meaning-Context.md)
* [Module 2 — Knowledge Representation (KR): The Design Space](modules/2_Knowledge-Representation.md)
* [Module 3 — Ontologies: Meaning with Structure](modules/3_Ontologies.md)
* [Module 4 — Graphs as Substrates of Meaning](modules/4_Graphs-As-Meaning.md)
* [Module 5 — Annotation, Extraction, and Interpretation](modules/5_Annotation.md)
* [Module 6 — Uncertainty, Provenance, and Identity](modules/6_Uncertainty-Provenance-Identity.md)
* [Module 7 — Neuro-Symbolic Systems: The Bridge](modules/7_Neuro-Symbolic-Systems.md)
* [Module 8 — Emergence, Discovery, and Cognitive Threads](modules/8_Emergence-Discovery.md)


## Process
The modules are designed to be AI assisted.

1. Start a new chat session.
2. Setup the context by:
* adding the [Module_Chat_Context.md](modules/Module_Chat_Context.md)
* adding in this prompt along with with the module text:
    > “I am currently working through Module [ADD YOUR MODULE NUMBER] and want help reasoning through the concepts, not summarizing them.”
* adding the module content
3. Use the AI to help you work through the guide and understand concepts.
