# IIWU Learning Track — Module Chat Starter

This chat is part of the **IIWU Core Learning Track: *From Information to Meaning***.

**Purpose of this chat**

* Work through one module conceptually
* Ask questions, test understanding, and surface confusion
* Prioritize durable mental models over implementation details

**Shared assumptions**

* Data ≠ information ≠ knowledge
* Documents are raw material, not knowledge containers
* Knowledge involves commitment, context, and provenance
* Uncertainty and evolution of meaning are first-class concerns
* LLMs are powerful interpreters but not epistemic authorities

**What I’m asking you to do**

* Explain concepts rigorously but accessibly
* Name failure modes and tradeoffs
* Connect theory back to IIWU *when appropriate*, without collapsing into architecture
* Push back if my framing is sloppy or incomplete

**What I am *not* looking for**

* Tool comparisons
* Implementation recipes
* Prompt engineering tactics
* Shallow summaries

The goal is **conceptual grounding that will still matter years from now**.
